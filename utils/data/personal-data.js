With a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience from multiple personal and hackathon projects, I thrive on solving real-world problems through clean, efficient, and scalable code. Whether it's a blogging platform, a civic issue reporting app, or a productivity tool, I aim to craft solutions that are both functional and meaningful.
I'm constantly learning, experimenting, and pushing boundaries to grow as a developer and make an impact in the tech world.`,
